qcmd
====

A command line program to issue connectionless (out of band) commands to quake servers.

Basically a cli version of rcon for Quake 2, but it should work for most of the Quake and related games.

To compile: 
run `make`  or try `gcc -o qcmd qcmd.c`

Usage:
`qcmd <dnsname-or-ip:port> <command>`
